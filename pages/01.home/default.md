# Welcome to ThinkMassive.org

My name is Alexander Miller, and this website is where I keep notes about my projects and research. 

### My Background

#### Early Days
As a kid I always enjoyed working with tools, electronics, and computers. During high school I read a couple textbooks about microprocessor system architecture([1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3867975-the-essence-of-microprocessor-engineering), [2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/950048.Microprocessor_Systems_Design)), and eventually worked by way through the basic systems course of the [Elenco Micro-Master](https://www.elenco.com/product/micromaster-computer-training-kit) training kit ([book](https://www.elenco.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MM8000K1-3.pdf)).

#### College
I attended Virginia Tech sporadically between 2002 and 2013 and eventually earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.

#### Early Career: DevOps @ Modes
During college I started working for a small agency called [Modea](https://www.modea.com), where I wore the hats of sysadmin, netops, devops, and backend engineer over the course of 7 years. We parted ways shortly after I relocated from Blacksburg to Durham. Eventually they spun out a division as [Ozmo](https://ozmoapp.com), and both companies are doing great to this day. I highly recommend checking them out if you're in their target market, or if you're looking for a tech job in Blacksburg, Virginia.

#### Big Data: Platform Support @ Hortonworks
While seeking experience in new fields I received an offer from Hortonworks, which is a primary developer of the Hadoop platform. The position was in support, but I saw it as an opportunity to get a crash course in real-world distributed systems, and I'm glad I took it. The environment was fast-paced and sometimes difficult, but I was able to exchange knowledge and techniques with talented colleagues.

#### Linux Distribution: Tooling Engineer @ Endless Computers

#### Blockchain: DevOps @ Shapeshift

#### Today
Currently my time is split between consulting and hobbies-that-might-become-a-hustle. See the [contact page](/contact) for details.
